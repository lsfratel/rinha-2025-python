# Rinha de Backend 2025

This repository contains my submission for the Rinha de Backend 2025.

# And what is this 'Rinha de Backend'?
Rinha de Backend is a challenge where participants must develop a backend solution using any technology, with the main goal of learning and sharing knowledge! This is the third edition of the challenge.

In this third edition of Rinha de Backend, the challenge is to mediate payment requests between two payment processing services while minimizing fees. The plot twist? These services will experience instability, and you must develop the best strategy to maximize processed paymentsâ€”all in a low-resource environment: just 1.5 vCPUs and 350MB of RAM!
